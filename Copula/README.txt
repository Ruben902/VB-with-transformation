This directory contains the set of MATLAB routines used for estimating the 
empirical example in Section 3.2 of 

Smith, Loaiza-Maya and Nott (2019) "High-dimensional Copula Variational Approximation
 through Transformation".

Below you can find a brief description for the main routine.

These were written by Ruben Loaiza-Maya, and if you have any related questions email rloaizma@gmail.com.
